###first stage

try the code ref of <<html,css,javascript from newer to expert>>.but after the exercise. I didn't get the skills. I think i need have a try with a project and a tool and read more book about css and js.

then ,i get some books from iutring china.The jquery,mobile html5. I do the exercise with the book. one day i got an api platform when the last year geekpark i had got. That is apicloud,although i did know the leancloud but i like this,because it is more suitable for me.i can do the project with this.i have spent 1500RMB,attend one course.after that I get the key. I do some project with it.and i found the confidence in this.

at this stage,i mainly use the javascript lib,i found this thing is very interstring and tired when you spent a lot of time to modify the css style. at that time i did learn the bootstarp lib,and many js lib,ex:swiper.js,zepto.js,iscroll.js,etc. I found do this with these libs is very good.but after that time i found at a lot of case,the lib can't solve my problem.I need study and study the css and js ,htl\ml,esphtnl5. 

and i did a proejct on weixin plactform and actruly the first web poejct of pc. I used the bootstrap and jquery,in order to fullfill the RDW.i found this is a fake subjcet.the RDW can't fullfille the perfect design and experience,ant at some the screem the user experience is bad.
